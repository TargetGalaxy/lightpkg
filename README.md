## LightPKG pacman/AUR wrapper written in Lua!!
This package depends on `lua, pacman, sudo, and git`
Most packages need the `base-devel` group to compile!
To install these run `sudo pacman -S lua git base-devel` 
Almost everyone uses sudo and pacman comes preinstalled on the OS this is targeted to (Arch Linux) so that's why we are only installing lua and git.
